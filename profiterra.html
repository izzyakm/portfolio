                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>Profiterra is an online accounting and consulting platform that helps small business owners to grow
                    into a profitable business by providing online bookkeeping, accounting services, and financial
                    advice for small businesses in Malaysia.
                    <br />
                    <br />This was a stepping stone for my career to dive deeper into UX context. I was able to practice
                    my UX skills as well as sharpen my UI skills. I spent most of my time working closely with the
                    founder and a small team to build Profiterra. </p>

                <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>For this project, I took a role as a UI UX designer and graphic designer.
                    My responsibilities included: Visual Design, Prototyping, Usability Testing and Develop high
                    fidelity mock-ups.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I worked alongside with a web developer to convert the prototype into a functional website. </p>

                <h4>Interview</h4>
                <p>On 8 September 2020, I received a phone call from Farah (founder) to discuss her business. We further
                    discuss her requirements through WhatsApp. We managed to have a quick face to face meeting on
                    September 11. I prepared some of the business questionnaires to guide the interview session. We
                    discussed her business plan and goals to understand their objectives and their brand identity.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Then I proceeded to understand her target user by conducting user research. During this research,
                    because we are under the second wave of Covid19, I interviewed close family and friends who own
                    small businesses through Whatsapp and video calls.

                <p>After listening and interviewing with our small business owners, we understand their pain points and
                    troubles in this matter.
                    From our understanding, our interviewees' common pain point is they feel like there is a missing gap
                    of all accounting firms in their digital world presence.
                    It's making it harder for small business owners to understand what services they provide and what
                    options they have. </p>

                        <p>To allow fluid navigation from one section to another, I implemented top-level navigation
                            bars at the highest point in the user interface architecture, enabling the user to dive into
                            a broad group of contents placed together based on some shared relationship. Include a
                            sitemap in the footer of every webpage, so when your users reach the end of the contents,
                            there is an obvious and instantly accessible navigation tool waiting to help them move
                            freely around the website, or at the very least to jump to another level within the site
                            hierarchy. To keep users' attention on the free consultation, redundant work is implemented
                            by adding a contact form section.</p>

                        <h5>02 Visual hierarchy</h5>
                        <p>Halfway through working on the project,
                            we realized that our client is so passionate to explain in great detail each of the services
                            provided.
                            This makes the webpage have some visual issues.
                            Research showed users tend to scan the page before they stumbled upon something that caught
                            their sight before reading the text.
                            Here, we use graphics to catch people's attention and direct their sight to the bold and
                            bigger heading text before moving to the actual content.
                            This visual hierarchy makes users scan for information clearly and easily.</p>

                        <h5>03 Resolve conflict by conduct user testing</h5>
                        <p>Later on in this project, I had a small conflict with my client.
                            he insisted that the contact page will have a detailed text instead of a bullet point of
                            information.
                            However, it would create a bad user experience for users to read text by text to find
                            important information.
                            After discussing the solution,
                            I convinced my client to conduct user testing to understand and simulate eye-tracking
                            studies.</p>

                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>It was my first time working on the user experience. I get to explore most of the design process.
                        However, I'm still in the learning process and still looking forward to conducting physical user
                        testing. This project was an extremely steep learning curve. It was an eye-opening experience
                        that taught me a lot about being organized and knowing when and where to focus your energy and
                        efforts.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So far, I did my best to translate from what I have learned on UI design. It definitely has room
                        for improvement in the near future. </p>

                        <li>
                            <b>Don't worry too much about the detail.</b>
                            In this project, I made the mistake of worrying about the look of the UI. Upon reflecting,
                            I need to reprioritize the UX.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Communication.</b>
                            I learned it's important to constantly communicate with my team
                            to make sure we all on the same page and have the same goals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Technology limitation.</b>
                            When working on the project, I don't understand how technology constraints can impact my
                            design and vice versa. I learned that I need to understand the developer's technology
                            consider that when designing the website.
