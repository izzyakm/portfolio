                    The Agro-food Productivity Nexus, under the management of Malaysia Productivity Corportation (MPC),
                    is a development initiative that focuses on the productivity development
                    in building connectivity of the agrofood supply chain.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The objective of this website is to enable easy, free, fast accessibility to the Malaysian agro-food
                    information to increase the stakeholder competitiveness and productivity of their businesses.
                    Include information, such as historic knowledge-based/records, current data/news, and future
                    intelligence/predictions.
                    Agrofood information includes the field of production, distribution, consumption, sustainability and
                    environment and acts as a toolbox.</p>

                <h4>Interview</h4>
                <p>On 20 December 2019, I joined Agro-food productivity Nexus Information ToolBox under Malaysia
                    Productivity Corporation (MPC) competition.
                    We were given a briefing to understand our task. During that time, there is a slot of question
                    answers session to get into stakeholders' minds. This was the session when I tried to ask many
                    questions to understand the project's requirements and direction.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Then I proceeded to understand users' points of view and their pain-points. During this time, I
                    understood the pain point of a farmer, supplier, student, and local man.
                    <br />
                    <br /><i>
                        "I don't have many resources, I'm just a small farmer, and it is hard to compete with a much
                        bigger farmer with bigger capital."</i>

                    <br /><i>
                        "It's not easy to understand our agriculture. It's hard to find a reliable source of information
                        about our agriculture on the internet. I wish there are a place where all the information was
                        laid out properly, so the next generation can study and understand them."</i>

                            However, because of the tight schedule, that doesnâ€™t allow him to have time to keep up with
                            his hobby.
                            Now that he has all the time in the world, he decided to start exploring his hobby again.
                            He began to go online and study the ways of gardening, plant vegetable at the back of his
                            house.
                            During the learning process, Ali started to search for a community to be part of growing and
                            learning from each other.
                            He finds that finding a community to transfer knowledge and share knowledge is very
                            difficult as they donâ€™t have a platform to centralized the community to reach out quickly.

                    is they feel like there is a missing gap of information in the digital world and a connectivity
                    gap of the supply chain. This leads to miscommunication and misinformation. Making it harder to
                    find a reliable source and accurate data.</p>

                    <p>Dealing with a multilevel panel and windows.
                        As a designer, we want to allow the user to navigate various levels from one point to
                        another on the UI.
                        Each level contains a different set of content grouped to avoid potential confusion,
                        and users can filter out their options and navigate straight to their desired option
                        with ease. </p>

                    <h5>03 Dividing the dataset into smaller groups</h5>
                    <p>When dealing with a large set of ordered data that is difficult to display on one page,
                        the user needs to view specific items.
                        The solution I came out with is splitting the contents of a website into discrete pages.
                        This method helps from overwhelming the user with a mass of data.
                        On this page, we also give a little bit more control for the user to let users choose if
                        they want to sort the search result by popularity, rating, recommendation, or
                        alphabetical order. </p>

                <h4>Finding:</h4>
                <p>
                    We pitched Agrow to a crowd and panel of stakeholders. We came as 3rd runner up. Overall,
                    it's a great experience to be involved in.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The feedback I received after we conduct the user testing and feedback from stakeholder are:
                    <br />
                <ul>
                    User's feedback.
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        The pages are easier and very pleasing to scan. However, the website doesn't contain
                        enough information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The registration forms are too complicated, with too many details. I don't have enough
                        details right now, so I cannot sign up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I like the ideas of the tab. We don't have to change to a different page. Hence, making
                        it easier to get information.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br />

                    Stakeholders' feedback.
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        The website is clean and minimal, but I think a lot of missing information. </li>
                    <li>
                        Why not use icons or pictures instead?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I like to see a more consistent look and feel

                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>Although we came in 3rd place, I am happy we share my idea, learn, and improve my design
                    thinking process. This project makes me realized there is more to just the web design and
                    aesthetic webpage. I learned about the functionality and user interface, and I started
                    exploring user experience even further. </p>

                <p>A few things I have learned throughout this project is:</p>

                    <li>
                        <b>Organizing Content.</b>
                        In this project, I made the mistake of not planning how I want to organize my content.
                        Hence, my design doesn't have a consistent look and feel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Focus on the problem.</b>
                        At the end of the day, it is the user's pains that we will be solving for so
                        keeping that front of mind is important as it's easy to lose sight of this when you're
                        to focus on the result and the aesthetic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Technology limitation.</b>
                        I started this project with research and understanding stakeholder point of view. We
                        were introduced to the developer. However, we have a tough time understanding the
                        developer's platform and her viewpoint. Ended up, she wanted to build a mobile web
                        instead.
