                            Because of this gap, there is inconsistency in the quality of standards and prices by local market leads to dissatisfaction and rejection by a massive corporation. </p>

                                    During the learning process, Ali started to search for a community to be part of growing and learning from each other.

                                After examining the generated Attention Map, the header gets a lot of attention. 
                                However, the CTA button is key to sales, traffic, and success. 
                                Hence, making the CTA button more comprehensive helps draw more attention without sacrificing the visual hierarchy. </p>

                            <p id=workp>The challenges I faced during the project is the website contains too much information that needs to be condensed down 
                                to achieve a simpler and minimal webpage that can is enjoyable and easy to navigate by everyone. The website also needs to cater to the diversity of demographic. 
                                Hence, making the decision to design is very difficult. Apart from different group people, 
                                the website also caters for diverse age group and different languages to make the knowledge transfer easier from farmer to bigger corporation. </p>

                            <h5 class="mt-5" style="margin:8vh 0 2vh 7.8vw;">08 Retrospective</h5>
                            <p id="workp"> Looking back, I think the concept and the design can be iterate even further, and improve the UI UX process. 
                                After presenting the idea and design to the users and stakeholder, they provided feedback to have better consistency in design. 
                                Upon reflecting, I decided to refine the design and focus the redesigning of the webpage with consistency. 
                                Overall, it's a great experience presenting my design and collaborating with MPC X NEXUS to contribute ideas helping to modernise the agriculture sector. </p>
